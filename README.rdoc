== Upload multiple files to Cloudinary with Carrierwave

=== Introduction

Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides an end-to-end image management solution including uploads, 
storage, administration, image manipulation, and delivery.

Cloudinary GEM provides a plugin for CarrierWave. Using it means that you enjoy the benefits of CarrierWave for easily 
uploading images from HTML forms to your model, while enjoying the great benefits of Cloudinary: uploaded images are 
stored in cloud, transformed and manipulated in the cloud, and delivered automatically through a CDN.

=== Carrierwave integration 

Integration of Carrierwave is pretty much straightforward and is [well documented.](https://www.google.com)

*Note:* The Carrierwave gem should be loaded before the Cloudinary gem.

`gem 'carrierwave'`
`gem 'cloudinary'`



I have been looking for a while at the Cloudinary's documentation on how to upload multiple files to it.
